# AI Quiz Generator - Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **API Key Management Problem**
- **Issue**: All API keys in `api_keys.json` were marked as `is_active: false`
- **Fix**: 
  - Activated all API keys by setting `is_active: true`
  - Created a comprehensive API key rotation system in `api_utils.py`
  - Added automatic key rotation when quotas are exceeded

### 2. **JSON Parsing Issues**
- **Issue**: AI responses containing code snippets with backticks broke JSON parsing
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved JSON extraction logic to handle code blocks properly
  - Added robust text cleaning to remove problematic characters
  - Enhanced error handling for malformed JSON responses

### 3. **Missing Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Poor error messages and no retry mechanism
- **Fix**:
  - Added intelligent retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
  - Better error messages for users
  - Automatic API key deactivation on quota errors

### 4. **Question Validation Issues**
- **Issue**: No validation of generated questions structure
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive question validation
  - Ensures exactly 4 options per question
  - Validates that correct_answer matches one of the options
  - Handles cases where AI returns options as dict instead of list

### 5. **Database Integration Issues**
- **Issue**: Missing support for marks_correct and marks_incorrect fields
- **Fix**:
  - Added proper handling of scoring fields in quiz creation
  - Better error handling during database operations
  - Improved rollback mechanism on failures

### 6. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Fix**:
  - Added loading indicators during AI generation
  - Added helpful tips and instructions
  - Added select all/none functionality for questions
  - Better visual feedback and error messages

## New Files Created

1. **`api_utils.py`** - Comprehensive API key management and AI generation
2. **`test_ai.py`** - Test script to verify AI functionality
3. **`manage_keys.py`** - Utility to manage API key status

## Key Features Added

### API Key Rotation System
- Automatically rotates between multiple API keys
- Tracks usage count and last used time
- Deactivates keys when quota is exceeded
- Easy reactivation for daily quota resets

### Robust AI Generation
- Improved prompts for better question quality
- Multiple retry attempts with different keys
- Comprehensive validation of generated content
- Clean JSON extraction from AI responses

### Better Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when API calls fail
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Usage Instructions

### For Normal Use:
1. Navigate to the AI Quiz Generator page
2. Enter a specific topic (e.g., "Python Programming Basics")
3. Select number of questions (5, 10, or 15)
4. Click "Generate Questions"
5. Review generated questions and select which ones to include
6. Fill in quiz details (title, time limit, scoring)
7. Click "Create Quiz from Selected Questions"

### For API Key Management:
```bash
# Check status of all API keys
python manage_keys.py --status

# Reactivate all keys (useful when quotas reset)
python manage_keys.py --reactivate
```

### For Testing:
```bash
# Test AI generation functionality
python test_ai.py
```

## Technical Improvements

1. **Modular Design**: Separated AI logic into `api_utils.py`
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
3. **User Experience**: Better feedback and loading states
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more API keys or change AI models
5. **Maintainability**: Clean code structure with comprehensive documentation

The AI Quiz Generator is now fully functional and robust!
